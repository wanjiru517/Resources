# DATA SCIENCE RESOURCES

One thing we have to embrace in the 21st Century is the reality that we will never stop learning. This applies for everyone interested in data science.
In case you haven't figured it out, data science is an umbrella term for a blend of skills related to working with data to deliver business value. Before I share the learning resources, I feel it's better to define a few things.

### Who is a Data Scientist?
According to [SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/what-is-a-data-scientist.html), data scientists are a new breed of analytical data expert who have the technical skills to solve complex problems – and the curiosity to explore what problems need to be solved. They’re part mathematician, part computer scientist and part trend-spotter. And, because they straddle both the business and IT worlds, they’re highly sought-after and well-paid. Who wouldn’t want to be one?

### The Lifecycle
The Data Science lifecycle is a key component in defining the various roles and skills required when working with data. It is well summarized in the [CRISP-DM framework](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/) which is commonly used when working on data science projects.

### Job Possibilities
From the lifecycle come various responsibilities and jobs that a data scientist can specialize in.

### Required Skills
The following are the must have skills per job role. Also I have to put a discalimer. This list is in no way exhaustive or representative of company expectations. So it's good to know something about each field.

### Finally, where to start.

The good news is there are a lot of free learning resources. I have a precompiled list of platforms where you can learn all about Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and AI.
